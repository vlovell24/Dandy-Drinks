## :bowtie: DANDY DRINKS :bowtie:

### :eyes: About
 Dandy drinks is a desktop application that uses thecocktaildb.com api to create a 
fun application for anything drink related. Generate random drinks, search for drinks 
by glass type, alcohol, alcoholic/non-alcoholic, or any ingredients. 

### :question: Why?
I created this as a beginner lesson in accessing api's, retrieving data and making a fully 
dynamic desktop application with Python and Tkinter. Plus...it has a super cool gif that I 
embedded into the home page. Gif's are neat, and it makes the application feel more webby.
